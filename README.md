# WiFi based Light Controller with Time & Weather Display including Alarm System
WiFi based Light Controller with Time & Weather Display including Alarm System.Today in our daily life, we all want an easy access to operate any electrical appliance to save our time. Sometimes we forget to turn on/off an electrical appliance, so we need such a system which will make our daily life easier and save our time. For that purpose, we did a project to control a home light remotely from any part of the world by using WiFi. Using WiFi, time and weather is also displayed on a LCD display and also alarms can be set. As we are normally worried about strangers who come in your house in your absence , so for that, we included a Stranger Alert Circuit which will send you an alert when a stranger enters your house. These all procedures are done by sending and receiving information through WiFi using a WiFi module and then controlling the output with the help of the micro-controller. So, this is a cost effective project which can control a light, display time and weather, set an alarm and give stranger alerts. The further applications can be Home Automation in which we can control many electrical appliances remotely. It also has an application in Security System in which we get information about the people entering a house which is helpful when any robbery or any other incident happens at your home.
